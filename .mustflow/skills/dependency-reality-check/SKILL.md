# Dependency Reality Check

<!-- mustflow-section: purpose -->
## Purpose

Prevent code, docs, tests, and final reports from assuming unavailable packages, tools, commands, runtimes, services, or platform capabilities.

<!-- mustflow-section: use-when -->
## Use When

- A change adds, removes, renames, imports, invokes, or documents a dependency, tool, runtime, command, plugin, service, or platform feature.
- A solution relies on a package manager, binary, environment variable, browser API, operating-system command, hosted service, or optional integration.
- A generated instruction tells another agent or user to run a tool that may not be declared in the repository.
- A failure may be caused by a missing install, mismatched version, unsupported runtime, or unavailable command.

<!-- mustflow-section: do-not-use-when -->
## Do Not Use When

- The task only changes repository-local prose and does not mention tools, runtime behavior, package metadata, or commands.
- The dependency is already proven by the current task context and no dependency-facing surface changes.
- The user explicitly asks for a speculative design that should not be implemented or verified yet.

<!-- mustflow-section: required-inputs -->
## Required Inputs

- The dependency, tool, command, runtime, service, or platform capability being assumed.
- Package, lock, config, import, script, command-intent, or documentation files that declare or reference it.
- The minimum version, capability, or availability claim if one is required.
- Relevant command-intent contract entries for build, package, test, or documentation verification.

<!-- mustflow-section: preconditions -->
## Preconditions

- The task matches the Use When conditions and does not match the Do Not Use When exclusions.
- Required inputs are available, or missing inputs can be reported without guessing.
- Higher-priority instructions and `.mustflow/config/commands.toml` have been checked for the current scope.

<!-- mustflow-section: allowed-edits -->
## Allowed Edits

- Align dependency declarations, imports, scripts, command metadata, tests, and docs that describe the same capability.
- Prefer existing repository dependencies and declared command intents before adding new packages or tools.
- Do not install packages, widen runtime requirements, or introduce new external services unless the user request and repository contract support it.
- Do not claim a dependency is available just because it exists on the internet or in another project.

<!-- mustflow-section: procedure -->
## Procedure

1. Name the assumed dependency or capability and where the task relies on it.
2. Check the repository declarations first: package metadata, lockfiles, config files, imports, command intents, docs, and templates.
3. Decide whether the dependency is present, absent, optional, transitive, host-provided, or external.
4. If present, verify that the requested capability and version expectation match the declared dependency.
5. If absent, prefer an existing local alternative. Add a new dependency only when it is necessary and within the task scope.
6. Keep all dependency-facing surfaces aligned: package metadata, lockfiles when intentionally updated, command contract, docs, tests, and installation notes.
7. Run the narrowest configured verification that proves the dependency path used by the change.

<!-- mustflow-section: postconditions -->
## Postconditions

- Every dependency or tool claim is backed by a repository declaration, configured command, host boundary, or explicit unverified-risk note.
- New dependency requirements are reflected in the appropriate metadata and public documentation.
- The final report states whether the dependency was existing, added, optional, unavailable, or intentionally not verified.

<!-- mustflow-section: verification -->
## Verification

Use configured oneshot command intents when available:

- `changes_status`
- `changes_diff_summary`
- `build`
- `test_release`
- `mustflow_check`

Use a narrower configured test, package, or docs intent when it better proves the dependency path.

<!-- mustflow-section: failure-handling -->
## Failure Handling

- If the dependency is missing, report the missing declaration or command instead of silently adding a workaround.
- If the declared version lacks the needed capability, report the mismatch and avoid claiming support.
- If a dependency requires network, credentials, operating-system setup, or service access, stop at that boundary and name the unchecked requirement.
- If generated docs would instruct users to run undeclared tools, rewrite the docs to use declared commands or mark the tool as a manual prerequisite.

<!-- mustflow-section: output-format -->
## Output Format

- Dependency or capability checked
- Repository declaration or absence
- Surfaces synchronized
- Command intents run
- Skipped dependency checks and reasons
- Remaining dependency risk
